# FairLens Insight

## Description
Develop and audit a classification model (e.g., loan approval, hiring suitability using synthetic or benchmark data) for potential bias against protected attributes. Uses Explainable AI techniques to visualize and quantify disparities, like having F.R.I.D.A.Y. double-check your work for fairness.

## Features
- Train standard classifiers (e.g., Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting) on datasets containing sensitive attributes (e.g., UCI Adult, COMPAS - handle responsibly, or generate synthetic data).
- Implement and calculate standard fairness metrics (e.g., disparate impact, statistical parity difference, equal opportunity difference).
- Apply post-hoc Explainable AI (XAI) techniques like SHAP or LIME to understand feature influence on predictions for different demographic subgroups.
- Create visualizations (using Matplotlib, Seaborn, SHAP plots) to compare model behavior and feature importance across groups, highlighting potential biases.
- Document findings on model fairness and the insights derived from XAI explanations.

## Learning Benefits
Gain practical experience in measuring algorithmic bias, applying state-of-the-art XAI tools (SHAP) for interpreting model behavior, understanding the nuances of fairness metrics, and visualizing complex data to communicate fairness assessments effectively. Develops crucial skills for responsible AI development.
